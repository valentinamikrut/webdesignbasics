				<h3>Thesis Collection Site: Three Key Components</h3>

				<h3>Informative</h3>
			
				<p>I would like to create a website that shows the entire process and outcome of my thesis collection. This will include text and visual research, prototypes, sketches as well as final outcomes. For my thesis I have four outcomes so I am creating four collections that all go together which I would like to effectively display on the site in a clear and cohesive way.</p>

				<h3>Visual</h3>
				
				<p>The site will have have a lot of imagery since it will be showing imagery from my entire process and I hope to incorporate relevant strong colours, from my moodboard, as well as minimal yet strong typography. I think I will want some pages to be mostly image based and other mostly text based and there will not be many pages that have as much text as images.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Interactive</h3>
				
				<p>I would like the interaction with the site to add to the experience, meaning that I would like it to enhance the mood and feeling of the collection as well as the information I am displaying. I know this will be a challenge but I hope to find a way to create exciting interactions. </p>

				<h3>Inspiration</h3>

				<p>An example of a site that I am inspired by is <a href="https://iad-lab.ch/">Interaction Design Lab's website</a> because it successfully displays interactive text and images in a form of a story. I really like the use of font size and colour as well as how well the text flows with the images. It is overall very inspiring because it is playful while still being minimal and informative.</p>
