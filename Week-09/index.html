				<h3>Informative</h3>

				<p>I would like to create a website that shows the entire process and outcome of my thesis collection. This will include text and visual research, protoyping, sketches as well as final outcomes. For my thesis I have four outcomes so I am creating four collections that all go together which I would like to effectively display on the site in a clear and cohesive way.</p>

				<h3>Visual</h3>

				<p>The site will have have a lot of imagery since it will be showing imagery from my entire process and I hope to incorporate relevant strong colours, from my moodboard, as well as minimal yet strong typography. I think I will want some pages to be mostly image based and other mostly text based and there will not be many pages that have as much text as images.</p>

				<h3>Interactive</h3>

				<p>I would like the interaction with the site to add to the experience, meaning that I would like it to enhance the mood and feeling of the collection as well as the information I am displaying. I know this will be a challenge but I hope to find a way to create exciting interactions. </p>
