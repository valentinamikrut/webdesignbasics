			<h3>PURPOSE </h3>

			<p>
				<br>
				<br>
				- The purpose of the website is to be a portfolio of my work. It should show a selection of my previous work in a well thought way that will attract potential employers and collaborations.
				<br>
				<br>
				- The portfolio is primarily intended for potential employers and collaborations.
				<br>
				<br>
				- I would like the tone of the siteâ€™s written content to be rather informal but still relatively professional.
				<br>
				<br>
				- The primary content of my site with be the pages of my work. I will mainly include fashion design work but will also include work within other areas, such as branding and photography.
				<br>
				<br>
				- The secondary content will be pages that allow the viewer to learn more about who I am as a designer. There will be pages such as, about and contact me for this.
