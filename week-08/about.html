			<div class="aboutintro">Hi! I am Valentina Mikrut. I am a Fashion Designer from Stockholm, Sweden. I am currently studying a Bachelor's Degree with a major in Fashion Design at Parsons School of Design in New York City. I am also minoring in Communication Design and am interested in Photography, as well as Interior and Spatial Design.
				<br>
				<br>
				I enjoy experimenting in many different ways, not only in the way in which I make garments and textiles but also in the way in which I research, build concepts and work through my entire design process. I enjoy creating more conceptual work that still has a strong sense of functionality and have found that I enjoy letting my process of research lead the path that I take. I am more interested in the process of creating rather than the outcome and strongly believe that allowing myself to spend time exploring different ideas, directions and thoughts leads to a more successful outcome. I try to look beyond how garments look and function, and find that my designs are often also informed by the experience of the wearer. I find the research and questioning process of great importance, as well as the functionality and aim of the collection. I want to keep exploring my thoughts and ideas about the world around me and the experiences I have in a way that creates thoughtful and interesting pieces of work.</div>
