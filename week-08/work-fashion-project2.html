		<h1>TRANSFORM</h1>
		<h2>KNITWEAR COLLECTION</h2>
		<p class="project-info">The knitwear collection is inspired by bringing two very different world and aesthetics together. It is inspired by Matilda Djerf, who is a person with an effortless and chic sense of style that seeks comfort in her clothing, and placing her in Tokyo. Tokyo can be seen as a completely different world and it is a place like no other. The collection in inspired by bringing these two worlds together. People can be highly influenced by new surroundings and this usually happens when it is a place that has very strong characteristics. This collection explores how people find themselves being affected by and adapting to new places and how their choice of clothing is affected by their new surroundings and lifestyle. It is inspired by how we transform ourselves depending on the surroundings we are in and how we transform when exposed to and influenced by different places. This collection is an exploration of what the outcomes can be when two different forms of personalities and aesthetics merge.</p>
